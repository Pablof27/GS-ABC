# Master Thesis - Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem using Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of the **Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP)** solved using an adapted version of the **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)** algorithm, developed as part of my Master's thesis.

## ðŸ§  Project Description

The RCPSP is a classic NP-hard problem where tasks must be scheduled considering resource availability and precedence constraints. This project explores the application of swarm intelligence, particularly the ABC algorithm, to find near-optimal solutions for RCPSP instances.

Key contributions include:

- A **discretized version** of the standard ABC algorithm tailored to the combinatorial nature of RCPSP.
- A **novel hybrid variation called GS-ABC (guided Search Artificial Bee Colony)** developed specifically for this project.
- Multiple **Python classes** to model project activities, resources, and scheduling logic.
